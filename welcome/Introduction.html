			<h3 class="mt-4">Accessibility </h3>
			<p>Learner variability forms the foundation of UDL.</p>
<p>The UDL framework supports the Ontario government's mandate under the AODA legislation and The Ontario Human Rights Commission Policy on accessible education for students with disabilities and it serves as a proactive guide for curriculum development in keeping with accessibility policies in all colleges and universities in Ontario. </p>
<p>The Social Model of Disability views disability as a consequence of environmental, social, and attitudinal barriers that prevent people with a disability from active participation in all areas of society. The model places the cause of the problem on society. </p>
<p>In a learning environment, the cause of the problem is that the curriculum and the institution have been designed by and for nondisabled people.  </p>

			<h4 class="mt-4">About the artist</h4>
			<p>Artist Kevin L. Pee-ace was born in Kelvington, Saskatchewan and is a member of the Yellowquill First Nation and Peter Chapman First nation.  Kevin's exposure to art happened at an early age.  He recalled seeing the drawings and paintings created by his uncle, Jerry Whitehead, who would later become  instrumental in helping to launch his career.  Upon graduating from high school in 1991, Kevin went on to complete a Fine Arts Studio diploma program from UCFV – Abbottsford, British Columbia.  During the mid-nineties, he explored various programs in Art History, Archaeology, Anthropology and Native Studies at Capilano College in North Vancouver.</p>
<p>Returning to Saskatchewan in 1995 Kevin enrolled at the UofS to continue his studies but quickly realized that the art was becoming more dominant thus committing to it full-time. Art and education have been constants throughout his career, this led to a collaborative approach in creating class murals with many schools throughout Saskatchewan. He currently resides in Saskatoon, Sk painting full-time. He is married and proud father to three children. He has three grandchildren; one grandson, Daniel, and two granddaughters, Raven and Aaliyah.</p>
