            <h2>Engaging in an Indigenous Way </h2>
            <p> The perspectives and pedagogies of Indigenous Peoples are shared in this course. There are many different Indigenous ways of knowing, but the Anishinaabe Teachings have had the most influence on this course. In particular, you will gain an understanding of the Seven Grandfather Teachings. As you learn about the experiences of Indigenous people through the content presented in the course, you may feel unsettled and/or emotional. If this happens, be guided by the principle of ‘Respect,’ i.e., acting respectfully and kindly to others. It is important to maintain a respectful dialogue with one another as we begin a conversation about Indigenous narratives. As you participate in this dialogue, we encourage you to reflect upon the false information that has been prevalent in colonial narratives and media representations of Indigenous Peoples. 
            <p>*Content Warning* These modules may cause you to feel unsettled and stir up a range of emotions. If you feel you need to talk to someone: <a href="https://good2talk.ca/">https://good2talk.ca</a></p></p> 
            <h3 class="mt-4"> Seven Grandfather Teachings </h3>
            <p>If you are unfamiliar with the Seven Grandfather Teachings, explore these prior to starting the course. They will give you some additional context to think about as you explore the course.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><a href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/movementtowardsreconciliation/chapter/the-seven-grandfather-teachings/#:~:text=The%20Seven%20Grandfather%20teachings%20are%3A%20Wisdom%2C%20Love%2C%20Respect%2C,learned%20through%20each%20chapter%20in%20this%20open%20textbook.">The Seven Grandfather Teachings &ndash; Historical and Contemporary Realities: Movement Towards Reconciliation (pressbooks.pub)</a> &nbsp;</p>
            <h3 class="mt-4"> Apply this to your course experience </h3>
             <p>The Seven Grandfather Teachings of the Anishinaabe Peoples are Wisdom, Love, Respect, Bravery, Honesty, Humility, and Truth. Some of these ideas are incorporated into the course in key moments when you will reflect on the knowledge presented.
It is important to note that all Indigenous Nations have their own knowledges, customs, languages, and ways of knowing. While there are some consistencies, there is no pan-Indigenous framework.
You will see the word knowledge pluralized throughout the course material. This reflects that Indigenous Knowledges are ‘place-based’ and Nation-based.

                    <p><b>Wisdom:</b> You should be able to speak well and to take well (what) someone says. When responding to a post do so from the lens of respect.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><b>Love: </b>It is your turn, you should love yourself before you love somebody who is different. Incorporate self-love and care into everything you create. </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><b>Respect: </b>You should think well of your teacher and peers. Create your assignments and posts with respect for your peers. </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><b>Bravery: </b>Be brave. Hold firm in your thoughts and stand strong even when you don’t know what will happen right now. Be willing to confront stereotypes you may already have. </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><b>Honesty: </b>Be honest first with yourself, and you will more easily be able to be honest with others. When creating posts, make sure that you speak from your heart in addition to your mind. </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><b>Humility: </b>Remember that you are equal to others, but you are not better. Reflect on this while creating your assignments and responding to discussion posts. </p>

                    <p><b>Truth:</b> Truth is to know all of these things. Speak the truth. Do not deceive yourself or others. Express these throughout your interaction with this course. </p>
